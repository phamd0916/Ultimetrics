    CONCLUSION: no sharpen or blur, best is grayscale
    - Cross 
        - grayscale is better than original
        - blur gets lost pretty much immediately
        - sharpen and blur_grayscale get lost near the
        end, from conor to jack 
        - sharpen_grayscale gets lost right away and
        starts focusing on a patch of grass
    - Running 
        - gets lost on all, worst in blurs and sharpen 
    - Throw
        - great on original, sharpen_grayscale,
        and grayscale
        - good on blur but not very stable
        - gets lost at the end on blur_grayscale and 
        sharpen

    CONCLUSION: no grayscale, best are sharpen + blur
    - Cross
        - great on original, blur_grayscale, blur, 
        sharpen, and sharpen_grayscale
        - gets lost on grayscale
    - Running
        - gets lost every time
    - Throw 
        - great on original, grayscale, sharpen, 
        blur_grayscale, and blur
        - good but not stable on sharpen_grayscale

    CONCLUSION: no grayscale, try sharpen and blur
    - Cross 
        - great on original, sharpen, and blur 
        - gets lost quickly and often on grayscale,
        sharpen_grayscale, and blur_grayscale
    - Running
        - original, sharpen_grayscale, sharpen, and
        blur got lost 
        - blur_grayscale, grayscale little bit lost 
        but ended up ok
    - Throw 
        - great on all
